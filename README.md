# Learner's Refined
Making student's lives easier.<br>
Built at HackACode for education theme

# Problem Statement
Since the unpredicted pandemic hit, lockdowns were imposed globally to prevent the spreading of the infectious Virus. This Virus brought in a serious lifestyle change to every sector of the society, including education. Students were now forced into virtual classrooms, taking their education completely online.

Learning through such platforms had not only increased the burden on students but had some major drawbacks.
