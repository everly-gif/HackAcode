# Problem Statement
Since the unpredicted pandemic hit, lockdowns were imposed globally to prevent the spreading of the infectious Virus. This Virus brought in a serious lifestyle change to every sector of the society, including education. Students were now forced into virtual classrooms, taking their education completely online.
